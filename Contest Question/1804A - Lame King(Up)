/*
Intuition-->
    If we have the permission to do consecutive moves then the answer would have been ---> abs(a)+abs(b).   
        But we do not have the permission to do consecutive moves so the abs(a)+abs(b) will be in my answer but we have to add something and that is 
            the difference between the ---> max(a,b)-min(a,b) this is the  diff that we have to add if a and b both are same or else ----> dif-1  
                cause we have to be stable at some point.
